# EB1A Template for Self-Petition

Below you'll find my self-petitioned EB1A Green Card Template. The source template is derived from that of [Razvan Marinescu](https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/) who was the inspiration for me to self-petition my own EB1A green card. I would recommend you check out my [blogpost](https://ryan-rhys.github.io/ryan__rhys/blog/2025/eb1a/) as well as Razvan's before you start working with this template directly. If you have any questions please open a GitHub Issue so that others may benefit from the answers!

## Installation

You may either clone the repo on the command line via:

```git clone git@github.com:Ryan-Rhys/EB1A.git```

or you may simply download the zipped folder from GitHub and re-upload it to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to start repurposing for your own needs.

## Contents

Here I have included a full template for the [I-140](https://www.uscis.gov/i-140) component of the EB1A application. Once the I-140 is approved you will need to submit the applicaton to register permanent residence, the [I-485](https://www.uscis.gov/i-485), separately. I would advise that you submit the forms separately as opposed to concurrently to save time in case the I-140 application is rejected. This template includes:

- Completed, anonymized administrative forms (I-140, G-1125, I-907)
- I-140 is the immigrant petition for alien workers
- I-907 is the request for premium processing
- G-1145 is the E-notification of application/petition acceptance
- The LaTeX file for the petition in `petition.tex`
- The pdf for the petition in `petition.pdf`
- Completed, anonymized reference letters in the `reference_letters`folders
- Auxiliary exhibits in the `aux` folder
- Further information on the journals I reviewed for in the `review_journal` folder
