# EB1A Template for Self-Petition

Below you'll find my self-petitioned EB1A Green Card Template. The source template is derived from that of [Razvan Marinescu](https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/) who was the inspiration for me too self-petition my own EB1A green card. I would recommend you check out my [blogpost](https://ryan-rhys.github.io/ryan__rhys/) before you start working with this template directly. If you have any questions please open a GitHub Issue so that others may benefit from the answers!

## Installation

You may either clone the repo on the command line via:

```git clone git@github.com:Ryan-Rhys/EB1A.git```

or you may simply download the zipped folder from GitHub and re-upload it to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to start repurposing for your own needs.
